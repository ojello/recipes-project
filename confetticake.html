        <h2>Funfetti Butter Cream Cake</h2>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <p>
            For the cake, preheat oven to 160°C (320°F), fan-forced. Grease 2 x 7-inch round cake pans. Line the bases with baking paper. Tip: If you would like to make a 4–6 layer cake but prefer not to level your cakes, pour the batter evenly into 4–6 pans and bake for 20–25 minutes.
<br><br>

            Combine flour, bicarb soda, cocoa and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
        
            <br><br>
        Using a handheld or kitchen mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter on high until smooth and creamy, or about 1 minute. Add sugar and beat on high for a further 2 minutes until creamed well. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed. Add oil and beat on high for 2 minutes. The butter may look like it is not completely combined with the oil, however, this is okay.
        <br><br>

        Add the egg yolks and vanilla. Beat on medium-high until combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula as needed. Beat in the vinegar and add food colouring, until it is the desired colour.
        <br><br>
            Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap, and set aside at room temperature in a cool environment until needed.
            For the lemon curd, whisk the eggs and yolks in a small non-reactive saucepan to blend. Whisk in the lemon zest, juice and caster sugar. Add the chopped butter. Whisk over medium heat, reaching into the bottom edge and scraping the sides and bottom of the saucepan, until butter is melted and mixture is thickened and beginning to simmer around the edges. Continue to whisk the mixture for a further 10 seconds.
            Remove pan from the heat and scrape into a strainer set over a bowl to remove the lemon zest (optional). Chill. Lemon curd will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks.
            <br><br>
            To assemble the cake, working on top of a cake turntable, secure the bottom layer of cake onto a cake board or plate with a dollop of Swiss meringue buttercream and then gently twist in place. 
            <br><br>
            Use a butter knife or an offset spatula to cover with a thin layer of lemon curd followed by a generous slathering of meringue buttercream, spread right to the outer edges of the cake.
            Place the second layer of cake on top of this and repeat the process until the last cake layer is assembled, leaving the last layer uncovered.
            Now, using an offset spatula and a cake scraper, gently crumb-coat your cake with a thin layer of meringue buttercream. 
            <br><br>

            Carefully smooth the sides of your cake until a desired finish is achieved. Use an offset spatula to smooth the top by gently pulling inwards from the outer edges of the cake into the centre, cleaning excess buttercream off your spatula with every scrape. Refrigerate for 15 minutes or until firm. Save leftover buttercream for the final decorative finish.
            Use an offset spatula to roughly apply a lovely rustic yet luscious-looking coating of meringue buttercream all over the outside of your cake.
            Divide the remaining meringue buttercream into separate bowls and tint with gel colouring until desired shades are achieved. Use a small palette knife to apply the buttercream colours in dabs and strokes, cleaning in between with every new colour. Before applying flecks of golf leaf, place your cake in the fridge for 15 minutes, or until firm.
            This Painted Buttercream cake is best enjoyed when served at room temperature. It can be refrigerated for up to seven days.For the lemon curd, whisk the eggs and yolks in a small non-reactive saucepan to blend. Whisk in the lemon zest, juice and caster sugar.
