        4 1/4 oz. (120 g) egg whites, at room temperature
        <br><br>
        1/2 vanilla bean (split in half lengthways and seeds scraped out)
        <br><br>
        2/3 cup (150 g) regular sugar, for the sugar syrup
        <br><br>
        1/4 cup (50 ml) water, for the sugar syrup
        <br><br>
        a drop of food coloring
        <br><br>
        1 1/3 cup (150 g) ground almonds
        <br><br>
        1 1/4 cup (150 g) powdered sugar
        <br><br>

        <strong>fillings:</strong>
        <br><br>
        lemon curd
        <br><br>
chocolate frosting of your choice
<br><br>
white frosting of your choice
       </p>

       <strong><h3>Instructions:</h3></strong>
       <p>
        Preheat the oven to 320 ˚F (160 ˚C).
           <br><br>
           Put the ground almonds, powdered sugar and half of the egg whites into a bowl.
           <br><br>
           Stir until everything is well blended.
           <br><br>
           Set aside for now.
           <br><br>
           In a small saucepan, stir together the seeds from the 1/2 vanilla bean and sugar and water for the sugar syrup. Heat until the temperature reaches 245 ˚F (118 ˚C).
           <br><br>
           Put the other half of the egg whites into a bowl with 2 tablespoons (35 g) sugar, whisk until frothy.
           <br><br>
           When the sugar syrup is 245 ˚F (118 ˚C), pour it into the meringue mixture.
           <br><br>
           Try to pour the sugar syrup down the inside of the bowl to avoid that the syrup touches the whisk.
           <br><br>
           Whisk for a few more minutes. If you are using food coloring, add it here.
           <br><br>
           Carefully fold the meringue into the almond mixture with a rubber spatula.
           <br><br>
           Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a large Wilton 1A tip. With the bag held vertically, pipe 1 ½-inch (4 cm) flat circles onto the lined tray, alternatively use a macaroon baking mat to achieve perfectly shaped macaroons.
           <br><br>
           Leave to rest for at least 1-2 hours, then bake on top of another (empty) baking tray on the bottom shelf in the oven for 10-15 minutes.
           Cover the macaroons with a sheet of baking parchment for the last 3-5 minutes to preserve the lovely pastel color. Remove from the oven and leave to cool completely.
           <br><br>
           These macarons make such a nice present, and they are perfect with a cup of tea or coffee.
           <br><br> 
           Enjoy!
